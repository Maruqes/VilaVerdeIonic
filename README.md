# VilaVerdeIonic
This is a university project built with **Ionic + Angular**.  
It’s not something I’d normally work on, but that’s exactly the point.

Sometimes, stepping out of the usual path leads to new perspectives.

## Tech Stack
- [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)

## Purpose
Academic purposes — built for a university assignment.  
Not necessarily aligned with my usual dev goals, but a nice detour.

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
ionic serve
